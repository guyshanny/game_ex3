Controls were implemented:
--------------------------
WASD/Space tail-following camera control 								

Known issues
------------
- We had some difficulties implementing inertia movements
- Collisions aren't perfect (we've implemented the camera thrust to be 3 frames before the real ship.
                             That's why sometimes there is an inconsistency in collisions.
                             But, collisions are OK the moment we cancel the thrust. 
                             We didn't cancel it because it makes the game more fun realistic)

Optionals were implemented:
---------------------------
- Skybox
- Better ship mesh - we used a simple ship's mesh
                     (https://clara.io)
                     we didn't use a more sophisticated mesh because it makes the game
                     heavier, and it takes time to be loaded
- Better collision detection - Bounding Boxes
- Better camera control - Thrust & Inertia (camera) - not perfect, but it's something :)
                          (We will have it better in the next version. It is BETA version now ;)
- Explosions (Post-processing) - Shaking
                                 Blurring
- Better Asteroids - random types of asteroids
                   - Animated textures (if we understood it right - animated asteroids)
- Sound and music - background music 

Running
-------
Pay attention - there are some static configuration in our solution (ex3.vcxproj) such as:
	- OpenMesh directories & libs
So, change it to your configuration before compiling.

Tallying
--------
= It was a very hard task, but it was really fun and interesting! =


Have a nice day :)
